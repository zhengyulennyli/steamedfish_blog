Lena had a week of training in Irvine, CA, so I decided to stop by there after Japan to meet up with her to fully take advantage of her free hotel room, rental car, and per diem. It was great to be back in a city where English was commonly spoken, and having the freedom of a car to go wherever I pleased.

Our typical day involved eating free made-to-order breakfast at the hotel, driving Lena to work 10 minutes away, and then settling in the Google Irvine office for the remainder of the day, taking full advantage of the snacks, free lunch, and gym. The Irvine gym actually has an outdoor section, cooling the muscles during heavy lifts with a light breeze. This is definitely one of my favorite hidden perks of working at Google: having access to any one of the 70+ offices around the world in major cities. Irvine is the sixth office I've visited outside of work after Montreal, Chicago, Boston, Seoul, and Taipei. After a few hours of interview prep and writing, I would pick Lena up from work and we would treat ourselves to a fancy dinner using her $100 per diem.

I hit up a beach volleyball meetup on one of the nights. While doing research, I realized that people in California play a lot more beach volleyball than indoor volleyball, since there's so much free public space for it. It's slightly more expensive to play beach volleyball in Manhattan, simply due to availablility of sand courts, but in Irvine it was the exact opposite. There were 5 courts available at the park where the meetup was held, all well lit throughout the night, and only three of the courts were actually being used the entire 3 hours we were there.

Another night, we checked out one of the climbing facilities. There was a groupon for an intro to climbing class that was cheaper than the day pass at the gym, so we both finally learned how to top rope. The gym the tallest top roping walls that I've ever seen, 3x taller than the walls at BKB. As a first time top roper, my fear of heights rather than physical and technical ability was what kept me from reaching the top of my climb.

Of all the places I've visited on my sabatical, Irvine is the place I wished I could spend more time in.
