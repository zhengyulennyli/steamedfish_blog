Japan is well-known for their animal cafes, where you can play with cats, owls, and in our case, hedgehogs. Dru and I visited Harry's Hedgehog Cafe in Shinjuku, where for the price of ~1000 yen you get a free drink and spend 30 minutes playing with a tank full of hedgehogs, which was more than enough time.

The hedgehogs aren't very interesting to play with, and I much prefered my meerkat cafe experience in Korea. These hedgehogs would either sleep in your hands or try to get out, but that was the extent of the interaction. Customers could also choose to take one home for 30,000-100,000 yen depending on the specific breed of the hedgehog.
