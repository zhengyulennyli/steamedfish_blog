I've decided that Hunan citizens are addicted to Mahjong, or at least my family is. The number of relatives I played Mahjong with during my 2 weeks in China was larger than the number of relatives I didn't play Mahjong with, and everyone knows at least how to play. It seemed like the universal language in the Changsha area, played by young and old to pass time during the new years break. There were days where literally all we did was eat and play Mahjong, which I guess isn't the worst way to spend time off work.

My grandparents have Mahjong tables which auto shuffle and stack the tiles for you, so we can play for free in the rural areas. Apparently, for those in areas without easy access, some hotel rooms come equipped with a Mahjong table. When I stayed with my cousin in NingXiang, he brought me to the hotel near his apartment where his paternal family (no relation to me) opened two rooms for Mahjong. I just wanted to check it out, since there wasn't much to do, but they persuaded me to sit down and play. Before I knew it, I had lost 1000 RMB in 30 minutes. Here's my explanation:

* They were playing 50 RMB for winning and 100 RMB for a self draw.
* They were playing a different style of Mahjong that I had never played before. I'm used to Changsha Mahjong, and they were playing a style that didn't require 2,5,8 and didn't allow eating neighboring tiles (you can still hit tripples).
* They had a special rule where if you self drew 4 of a kind, everyone pays you 100 RMB. If someone gives you the 4th tile, they owe you 50 RMB. One guy self drew 4 of a kind 3 times. I did not self draw a single time.

After losing 1000 RMB, I got up and said I'm done playing. "What, already? We just started." I felt like I got scammed, but it was better to cut my losses here. I had no relation to these people, and promised myself that I would only play smaller stakes and with family from now on.
