Still addicted to working on our terrain park riding, Nam and I planned a mid-week day trip to Mountain Creek in New Jersey, with only three days of rest after our four day adventure in Stowe. Mountain Creek, well known for its terrain parks, is only an hour and a half from Manhattan, and lift tickets for the day were only $30. Now we know why.

Only one section of the mountain was open, but there were plenty of jumps and features to try. We had a great time in the morning applying our practice from the weekend in Stowe, but by lunchtime, we were exhausted, our bodies not fully recovered yet from the weekend marathon. It was a good time to call it quits, since half of the mountain was full of slushy water, making it impossible to pick up enough speed to clear any of the jumps.

This was my second time visiting Mountain Creek, and both times were slushy. Unless it's the middle of winter, it's probably too difficult to maintain snow during the warm weather. I always see videos of people snowboarding in a hoodie or even a t-shirt, and I wonder how or where that ever happens, but clearly not in New Jersey.
