Japan produces some famous climbers, and I think it's cool to be able to check out the rock climbing gyms in the cities I visit, so I looked up some places in Tokyo when I arrived. My initial surprise was that there were a ton of options, around 50 in all of Tokyo and at least 10 in Shinjuku, the closest hub to where I was staying. After reading a few reviews, I settled on two in Shinjuku that I wanted to check out.

The pricing model seems to be pretty similar across facilities. You have to pay an initiation fee of 1000-2000 yen, and each visit will cost another 1500-2500 yen. Some places offer monthly passes, and others had early bird specials where the day pass was cheaper depending on what time of day you went.

The first gym I went to, Boulcom, was much smaller than I expected. There was only one room for bouldering, so after a quick peek I decided to head to the other place, Pump Climber's Academy. Luckily, I had gone to a gym they work with 8 months ago when I was last in Tokyo called B-Pump, and was already in the system so I didn't have to pay the 1000 yen initiation fee. The day pass was 2100 yen.

This facility had three floors, with standard bouldering on the first floor, including a cave-like area. The problems were rated based on colors, without any V-system that we're familiar with in the States. They also had a treadmill climbing wall and a breakroom with desk space and a vending machine. I was able to work on my travel blog while climbing, but unfortunately there was no wifi.

The second floor had the locker rooms, which are just changing rooms (no showers). Each locker has a key allowing users to lock up their stuff without having to bring their own lock. There was also a yoga room with full length mirrors on two of the walls, perfect for practicing Capoeira when I was tired of climbing.

The third floor had two traverse walls, short in height, with a timer that would count down and beep every 30 seconds. Apparently climbing classes are taught in these facilities, probably for competitive speed climbing.

My least favorite thing about climbing is having strangers behind you waiting for their turn while they watch you struggle with an easy problem. Luckily that was not the case while I was there (late weekday afternoon). It seemed like often times there were more staff than there were clients.
