I was supposed to go to Brazil after spending a week in Portugal with my family, but I forgot to get a visa. My American ignorance just assumed I could go to pretty much any country I wanted with my US passport, but unfortunately I had to miss my flight to Sao Paulo and then cancel my flight from Brazil back to NYC. Since I had a great experience at my surf camp in Dakar, I looked for one near Lisbon and realized there were a ton. Not wanting to invest too much time researching, I picked a hostel that had kite surfing, excited to finally learn this sport that has been so aluring.

The hostel had a shared room available for the week, and the total package including breakfast, dinner, 12+ hours of kite surfing lessons, and unlimited surf gear rentals was 629 euros. The room had three bunk beds to be shared by 6 people. Each bed had curtains for privacy, and I was able to sleep surprisingly well each night. There were actually more staff and volunteers at the camp than actual paying guests, so the house was very clean throughout the day, and always lively. The volunteers work five days a week, six hours per day cleaning the house and managing the rentals. In return, they get free housing, breakfast, and access to free rentals and surf lessons. Not a bad deal, although you have to volunteer for a minimum of 6 weeks.

I was the only one doing kite surfing from the hostel, and my lessons were in the afternoon each day, so I had time in the morning to do some regular surfing on my own. We had access to bikes that we could use to commute to the surfing spot each day, and I made lots of progress riding white water during my time here.

My kite surfing lessons were taught by George, who although was in his 40s was still very active, doing crossfit every morning before teaching kite surfing every day. He would pick me up from the hostel and we would practice everyday until I got too tired, so I got much more value out of the program than the advertised 12 hours of lessons. We were doing at least three hours each day for 5 days, and that's not including the 30+ minutes of driving to and from the kite surfing lagoon. Some days there were other students, but I still got lots of attention.

The first day we learned how to setup/takedown the kite and fly on the beach. FLying the kite isn't difficult, but definitely takes an hour or so to get comfortable with it. We worked on flying with one hand, and moving the kite between 11 and 1 oclock. There were often pedestrians walking by and standing around staring at the kites while we're clearly having lessons. Super annoying, considering we were all beginners and could have easily dropped a kite on them.

The second day we learned how to let the kite drag our body through the water with one hand while holding the board with the other. Again, this was pretty easy to do once you got the hang of it.

The third day I tried to stand up and spent a lot of time face diving into the water and consuming 1000% of my daily sodium intake. I was able to stand up by the end of the day, but was not looking promising.

The fourth day, I spent more time trying to stand up, and was ocassionally successful in going down wind. I basically had a private lesson today and my instructor would meet me downwind and ride the kite back upwind, and I would walk along the side of the lagoon to meet him before repeating the process.

My goal for the fifth day was to learn how to go upwind, and I'd say I was partially successful. I could go upwind occassionally, but it was often two steps downwind and one step upwind, since everytime I made a mistake I would drift downwind a bit. Today was especially tough not only because I surfed in the morning, but since there were other students, I had to walk the kite back upwind on my own. Walking the kite upwind either requires walking backwards, which is super annoying, or zigzagging back and forth, which is super inefficient. Kite surfing itself isn't very tiring, but hiking back upwind killed my stamina.

My instructor said I made great progress through the five days, but I'm a bit upset I couldn't master riding upwind. I was told kite surfing is easier to learn than surfing, but there are ao many things going on between flying the kite, balancing on the board, and controlling the handlebars. I think what they actually mean is that kite surfing is more accessible whereas it takes alot of atheletic ability to learn how to surf. The actual learning process was not easier.

I'm not sure if I want to continue to invest in this sport, since the sensation of riding on water is similar to snowboarding, but I have yet to fly 20 feet in the air, which is what inspired me to try the sport in the first place. Hopefully I'll have another opportunity to take another intensive week long course and improve my riding ability even further, but if not, I'll always be able to ride the terrain park on my snowboard.
