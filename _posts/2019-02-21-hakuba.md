My main desire to visit Japan was to take advantage of the free 5 days of lift tickets at Hakuba that comes with my Epic Season Pass. Hakuba valley was the home of the Winter Olympics in 1998, boasting 7 different ski resorts connected by their free shuttle system. I've heard of the deep powder in Japan and seen epic videos of back country snowboarding, but was a bit dissapointed when I arrived. It hadn't snowed for almost a week, and the warm weather turned any chance of powder in to slushy rain.

Nevertheless, I tried to take advantage of my time there. Since I was snowboarding alone for 3 days, I signed up for a full day group lesson on day 1 and a two hour private lesson on day 2. I also visited four out of the 7 resorts in my time on the mountain.

My first day was the highest level snowboarding lesson at Happo One. There were five of us following an instructor from Canada, who flew into Japan for the season to teach snowboarding five times a week. We focused on jumps and 180s off groomed trails and banks, working on our style and switch riding throughout the day.

My second day was at Hakuba 47, home of the only terrain park (including an Olympic grade half pipe) in Hakuba. I decided to splurge on myself and invest in a two hour private lesson focusing on terrain park tricks. Before this point, I had only been able to do small jumps and 50/50 on boxes, and my landings were awkward. By the end of the two hours, I was linking my half pipe turns with 180s (never getting air or exiting the half pipe), comfortably taking off and landing medium size jumps with a board grab, front boardsliding boxes, 50/50 on rails, and 180s off small jumps. It was really useful to get a lot of repetition in that day and have a professional watch my form closely. The most impactful piece of advice I received was to simply bring my knees to my chest on my jumps. Before, I would keep them extended and bend them to soften the landing, but extended legs are unstable and awkward in the air, making it hard to land flat on the ground. I started landing every single straight air jump after learning this secret trick.

Snowboarding doesn't bring me joy like it used to. I remember when I first learned the sport, I wouldn't be able to sleep the night before a trip, spending the late hours in the morning imagining myself cruise down the mountain. It's great that I can finally sleep before trips now, but I've lost the original excitement I've had, probably because I felt like I was hitting a skill plataeu. Now that I've seen a path to improve my riding in the park, I'm suddenly inspired to crank out more days in the mountain this season, and set goals for where I want my riding to be a year from now.

The last day was pretty uneventful. After checking out Iwatake, I got bored of the groomed runs and took the shuttle back to Hakuba 47 to get in some more reps at the park. The free shuttle bus system was great for getting around Hakuba Valley.
