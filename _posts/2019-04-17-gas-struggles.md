My transportation struggles continue in Portugal. Yesterday, we drove up to Porto from our hotel in Sintra (3 hours) for the day, checking out a wine cellar, and then surfing and playing volleyball on the beach. Before leaving Porto that evening, my family stopped by a gas station... and I put in the wrong fuel. I definitely could have been more cautious, but in my defense:

* There was a long line of cars behind me waiting to fill up, so I didn't want to take too much time.
* I picked the nozzle on the left, which was labeled "Simples Gasoleo," assuming that it was the most basic gasoline. If I had read all the other labels, I would have noticed "Gasolina95" which is what we actually wanted.

So a few minutes after leaving the gas station, our car starts sputtering and breaks down. I thought it was an issue with the car at first, but my mom astutely pointed out that we may have put in the wrong type of fuel. The three of us, including my sister, spent the next half hour trying to figure out what phone number to call in Portugal for Roadside Assistance.

* The Sixt (rental car company) customer service line was closed for the day.
* We found a few numbers online, but they were either not in Portugal or they only spoke Portuguese.
* I looked on Google Maps for nearby auto shops, but they were all either closed or not actual auto shops when I walked to them. They either didn't have phone numbers listed or had numbers that didn't work.
* We tried calling the Sixt roadside assistance number on the rental car paper we had, but the automated teller spoke Portuguese. After trying some combination of button presses, my mom was able to get another human on the other line who spoke English. Apparently, this insurance company didn't serve Sixt anymore, but he was able to provide us with another phone number to try.
* The next phone number we tried asked for our location and vehicle info, and then said he would call us back in 30-35 minutes.

During this process, a nice man who didn't speak English helped us push our car into the parking area of a church nearby, so we didn't take up space on the road.

At this point, I was starting to panic. Who knows how long the roadside assistance could take, or if they are even planning on helping us? It was dark, around 8pm, and our cell phones and external batteries were dying. None of us had a power adaptor to charge our devices for the night either.  Maybe we should try to find a hotel for the night before they all close.

I still had the hope that we could make it back to Sintra that night, and started walking towards the nearest gas station. This cocky engineer (lol software) thought he would be able to figure out how to siphen the diesel out of the rental car and replace it with gasoline on his own.

On the walk towards the gas station, my mom saw an autoshop across the street that looked like it was about to close up. I quickly approached the man who had just driven a van in.

"Fala Ingles?" my goto phrase in Portuguese.

"Um pouco," the man replied.

Thank godness for Google translate, as I proceeded to communicate our woes through my cellphone. It was slow, but eventually he understood the issue and decided to help us. When we got to our car, he tried to explain something to me. It seemed too complicated even with Google Translate, so he gave up and started the siphening process.

My mom had the great idea of finding a couple walking their dogs to come help us translate. We learned that there was a strike in all of Portugal by the fuel truck drivers that literally started today, causing a shortage of both gasoline and diesel throughout the country. Well, that explains the long line at the gas station earlier. Our translator also explained that the mechanic is willing to help us remove the diesel, but he's unwilling to wait in a long line to get gasoline, and needs to go home to his family. If we could get gasoline before the siphening was complete, the mechanic was willing to finish the repair tonight, but otherwise had to get home to his family. I guess luckily for us we had a full tank of diesel for him to remove, which took around an hour.

My mom and sister walked to the gas station to fetch a few liters of gasoline, while I waited with the mechanic, scolding myself for not spending more time learning Portuguese over the past few months. They were back with 10 liters of gasoline right as the siphening was complete. Yes, we were going to make it home tonight!

After the diesel was removed from the fuel tank, the mechanic still needed to clean the engine by running gasoline throughout the system, a complicated process that took another half hour or so. I definitely would not have been able to figure all this out on my own. We paid him 100 euros for his time (he only asked for 60), and happily went on our way. Now we just needed to find a station that still had gasoline to fill up the rest of our tank.

We had no other issues that night, getting home at 2AM, and thankful for the kind strangers we met throughout the night: the man who helped us push our car off the street, the nice couple who translated for us and hung out with us for half an hour, and of course the mechanic who spent two hours working overtime to help lost traverlers get home.

Oh, and the roadside assistance eventually got back to us over an hour after I called. Definitely downrating the rental car company for lack of accurate and helpful information.
