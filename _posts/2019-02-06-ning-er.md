We went to see a Chinese show that loosely followed the history of the Battle of MuYe. The plot wasn't that interesting (typical girl meets boy, girl dies, boy avenges girl, oh and this girl never actually existed in history), but the use of the entire auditorium was cool. We saw actors on harnesses fly above the audience as the approached the stage for battle, representing the emporor's army coming down from the heavens. Here's a cool clip I got.
