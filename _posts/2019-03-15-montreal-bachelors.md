My old coworker, John, invited me to my second bachelor's party. It would be my second time in Montreal and first time experiencing the heterosexual night life in the city. My first time visiting Montreal was for a Gay volleyball tournament, so I experienced the opposite side of the spectrum two years prior.

My first bachelor's party was in Vegas, where we slept a total of maybe five hours the entire weekend. That weekend involved clubbing, strip clubs, gambling, pool parties, and expensive dinners. It would have been a huge hit to my wallet if not for winning ~$1500 gambling over the weekend. That might have been why I slept so little. Having a hot streak all weekend meant waking up at 7AM after going to bed at 4AM to continue gambling.

Similar to my good fortune in Vegas, I had great luck on my trip to Montreal, although not in the Casinos. This was the first weekend after the Boeing 737 crashes, and combined with the bad weather, a lot of flights were getting cancelled or rescheduled. Many of the 10 guests arrived a day later than intended, and the best man took an overnight bus after having his flight completely cancelled. I left on Friday morning, and my Delta flight was overbooked by 11 passengers, probably because they switched out the larger 737 for a smaller plane. Delta's known for their great customer service (and they certainly won my business after this incident), and asked for volunteers to get on a later flight with a bid starting at $500. I immediately hopped on this opportunity, and got placed on a flight for five hours later. After six volunteers, the only available next flight was for the next morning. The bidding started getting higher and higher, eventually reaching $1400 before all 11 volunteers were round up. They gave each of us a $1400 gift card of our choice (I chose Amazon) for our troubles, even though I volunteered at the $500 price point.

This weekend in Montreal was with an older crowd (I was the youngest by 5+ years), and many of the guests were married or in long term relationships, so I wasn't sure how crazy we would get. Nevertheless, after surveying the crowd on the first night for their interests, I volunteered to manage night time activities with a promoter connect I had through Dan Kim.

Our night at the strip club and table service at a night club cost $160 CAD per person (~$130 USD), much cheaper than our experience in Vegas where we spent $200 per person just on table service and then another $40 per person to just get into the strip club. Throughout the experience, our promoter Adriano was very professional, and tried to understand our group before recommending places and experiences. He described in detail the different possibilities we had, from renting out a go-karting place and betting on naked strippers racing the go-karts to eating sushi off a naked model at one of the high end sushi restaurants in the city. During the actual night, he was always waiting at the entrance of the establishment, helping us skip the long lines at both the strip club and the night club. He even had connections with the restaurant we already had reservations at and helped us increase our table size from 9 to 10. I usually think promoters are a waste of money unless you're a group of hot girls (then you can go where ever the fuck you want and get free booze), but Adriano was definitely worth every dollar we paid.

The strip club experience was better than in Vegas, although I remember the girls in Vegas being more attractive. It was ~$15 CAD per song for a dance ($20 per song in Vegas). The difference was that the Montreal dances were in private areas, whereas the Vegas dances were always out in the open for everyone to view. You had to pay an extra $100 or so to go to the private rooms, the most you'll ever pay for blue balls. Might as well get a prostitute at that rate. One of the best experiences at the strip club was finding out that we could pay the bouncer $140 CAD to have our bachelor, John, go up on stage with two strippers. They stripped him down to his underwear and made him dance in front of everyone (we got it on camera). Afterwards, they had him lay down and whipped his bare ass with a leather belt. Best $140 I've ever spent at a strip club.

The night club was similar to clubs in Manhattan in terms of music and crowdedness, although people genuinely looked like they were enjoying themselves (unlike Mission). Our bottle girls were also much friendlier and acted like real humans. They poured us shots and drinks and would dance with us during their free time.

Our weekend certainly wasn't as ratchet as my first bachelor party experience. I got a full eight hours of sleep on both nights, and we even did a wholesome group activity together in the afternoon. Curling was more fun and interesting than I expected, partially due to our enthusiastic instructor who guided us throughout the process.

In terms of spending your bachelor's at Montreal vs Vegas, I would definitely go with Vegas to save money. The only downside to Montreal is that there's only one Casino. One of the perks of Vegas was the ability to gamble wherever you went. We never made it to the Casino in Montreal due to the inaccessibility, and I didn't get to test my gambling luck during bachelor parties.
