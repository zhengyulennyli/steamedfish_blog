Fireworks are a tradition for new years around the world, but unfortunately, it's illegal to launch fireworks in Chinese cities, so instead we go to the countryside where we can do whatever the fuck we want. No really, these people just throw trash out on the sidewalk and someone will come clean it up later. I've also seen some families burning their trash in a bonfire. For us, it means we can launch fireworks in our front yard on New Years.

I also found out, unfortunately in the moment, that it's okay to launch fireworks at 6AM in the morning. This tradition on New Year's day simultaneously deprives neighbors of a good night's rest and wishes them good health and fortune in the new year.
