Before I left for China, my mom mentioned that I needed to prepare red envelopes for my grandparents (1000 RMB each), and all of my aunts and uncles (800 RMB per family). At first I was thinking, wow, that's a lot of money (~10k RMB), and reluctantly agreed. In Chinese New Year culture, red envelopes are typically given to the generations below and above you.

My wealthy/generous uncle, XiBing, actually gave me a red envelope (2k RMB) first, so I didn't end up giving him one. In my mind, it wouldn't make sense for him to give me a red envelope and then for me to give him one back, but apparently that's quite common. It's part of the culture to exchange red envelopes, and some of the folks I gave money to gave some back. Oops, sorry, Uncle Xi.

There's also a question of who I actually need to give red envelopes to. I gave red envelopes to all of my younger cousins (the ones without jobs), but I didn't need to give any money to the kids of my cousins because I'm not married yet (and hence still a kid). It still seems somewhat arbitrary to me, but when in doubt I've decided to be generous unless told directly that I needn't give one.

Red Envelopes aren't only given on new years, though. They're also given during weddings, birthdays, and for having a kid. I much prefer this tradition over western culture which seems wasteful, potentially giving gifts that are often regifted, thrown away, or never uesd. One of my cousin's recently had a child, and treated everyone to dinner. The dinner cost him aroudn 50 RMB per head (it was in the rural area), and he collected ~500-1000 RMB in red envelopes in gifts. Weddings are similar, where you can pay between 50-500 RMB per head but collect 1000 RMB+ per head in red envelopes. I definitely need to host a dinner in China when I get married and have kids.

WeChat, China's super app, allows users to send money to one another. One of the games we often play is to send a red envelope (100-200 RMB) divided randomly among the first 8-10 members in a group chat that click on the envelope. The person who received the most usually sends the next envelope until we all get bored.
