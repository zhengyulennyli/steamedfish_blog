We took a day trip today to Fujikyu Highlands, a famous amusement park next to Mt. Fuji and only a couple hours from Tokyo. Each one of the coasters we rode today held the world record for something at some point. We went on a weekend, and the lines were pretty long, but we paid for fast passes (~10USD each) to skip some of the lines.

Takabisha: Steepest drop in the world at 121 degrees. A 90 degree drop would be straight down, so 121 degrees means that you're dropping backwords...? You'll have to look at a picture of the drop to understand.

Eejanaika: Literally translates to "not good" and is the second "4th dimension roller coaster" ever built. Obviously not actually 4 dimensions, but the 4th dimension simply refers to the 360 degree rotation of the seats, allowing for 14 different inversions.

Do-Dodonpa: Once the world's fastest rollar coaster and still has the highest acceleration. You can feel your vision fading during the launch to reach a max speed of 172 km/h.

Fujiyama: At 79 meters tall, it was once the tallest rollar coaster.

One of the more interesting experiences we had during our visit was a game similar to escape the room. In teams of 2-4, we had to explore a maze with three sections and 10 rooms, and defeat the challenges in five of the rooms. Presumably, there were multiple rooms to allow for multiple teams to attempt the game at the same time. The first part of the game was to explore the three sections and find hidden codes to unlock with our handheld device. Then, we had to visit each of our assigned five rooms and defeat the challenge inside. The first room we visited required us to get to the other side of the room without touching the floor in two minutes. There was a balance beam along the wall for us to traverse, and each second we touched the floor we lost ~20 seconds of time. Unfortunately we failed and were immediately asked to leave. Apparently, failing a single one of the rooms means that the game is over. Unsatisfied by our experience, we decided to go for another attempt, each spending another $10 USD for a fast pass to allow us to skip the 1 hour line. The first room we visited on our second attempt at the game involved a two part challenge. The first was getting to the other side of the room, only moving when the "AI" closed it's eyes. The second part involved having one person mimic five poses correctly in a row. We failed again decided to go home after that. Overall, I think the idea was great, but the execution was poor. Making people leave after failing a single challenge certainly moves the line along quickly, but it sucks to have to wait so long just to fail immediately. The second part of the second puzzle we attempted was super gimicing as well. Why have a challenge that only one person can do for a 2-4 person team?
