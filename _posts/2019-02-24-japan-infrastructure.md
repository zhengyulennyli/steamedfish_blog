Everytime I visit Japan, I'm always envious of how great their public infrastructure is, and disappointed by New York's so called "greatest subway system in America."

# Time Schedule

All of Japan's subways and trains are ontime to the minute, with data imported into Google Maps and shown on the station's monitors. Amtrak in the States has a similar feel, with trains following a reliable, set schedule, but the New York metro is a mess. Trains come and go at unpredictable times, and the station's that do have dashboards to display eta's aren't even accurate. It's such a pain to ride the subway, especially on the weekend when the trains are even more sparse. Trains are delayed every single day, a rare event in Japan that would spark the CEO of the train company to issue a public apology.

# Public Restrooms

One of my biggest fears while traveling is wandering around the streets all day and not being able to find a public restroom. The free ones in Starbucks and McDonalds have long lines and are often gross. In China, many restrooms will lack toilet paper. Japan, however, is a safe haven for pooping, with clean restrooms and heated toilet seats in all train stations.

I've never been to a restaurant in Japan that lacked a public restroom. I landed in LA after Japan, and my lunch spot didn't have one. I went to five different places, including a Starbucks and Subway, before I found a restaraunt that let me use their public restroom.

# Bullet Trains

Japan is famous for the Shinkansen, their network of high speed bullet trains, with maximum speeds of 240-320 km/h. For comparison, Amtrak's max speed is 240 km/h as well, but most trains max out at 160 km/h. The bullet trains allow travelers to take day/weekend trips from Tokyo to anywhere in Honshu, removing the necessity of local air travel in the large island.

# WiFi

All of the train stations, Shinkansen, and public buses have free, high-speed WiFi. New York advertises high-speed WiFi.
