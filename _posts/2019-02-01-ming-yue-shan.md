On our road trip from Shanghai to Changsha, we stopped by 明月山 for one night to enjoy the natural hot spring spa. The spa experience itself is very similar to those found in New York, except with outdoor facilities to bathe in for an unlimited amount of time with a flat fee (around 100 RMB per person).

One unique part of the visit was paying an extra 20 RMB to bathe for half an hour in a pool of fish that eat away your dead skin. I couldn't last 10 minutes in the incessant attack of tickling nibbles.

The next morning, we visited the famous hot spring well, where the elderly commonly come hang out and soak their feet in buckets of the mineral water. We decided not to soak our feet, but did scoop out some of the water to drink. “Delicious, my aunt said.” “What are you talking about, it tastes like plain water.” (loosely translated)."
