My cousin, Liu Dan, took me to a famous footbath/massage/movie theater place in Ning Xiang today. For ~120 RMB per person, the four of us were escorted to a private room with comfortable couches and a projector. We put on a movie and each had our own personal masseuse bathe our feet and rub our back and shoulders for the next hour. Liu Dan was so comfortable that he fell asleep for a good half of his massage.

I'm not sure if other extras go on in this establishment because every masseuse was a young woman dressed in a form fitting short red dress. Maybe there are private rooms for those interested in more. Massage places I've been to in Chinatown New York feel like a hole in the wall compared to this brightly lit entertainment center.
