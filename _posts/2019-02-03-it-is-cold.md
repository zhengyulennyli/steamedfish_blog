It was my first time spending Chinese New Year as an adult in China, and my first experience of Chinese winters. I did not pack enough, bringing only one pair of jeans, a thin hoodie, light sweater, and my ski jacket. Apparently in the Northern parts of China, people keep the heat running throughout the day similar to Western culture, but in the South where I'm from, insulation is terrible and we only turn on the heat when it's extremely cold. At my paternal grandparent's home, the living room heat was only on for one out of the four days I was there. Instead, everyone crowds around a small table with a space heater under it. A blanket is put over the surface of the table to maintain the warmth underneath, and everyone sits with their legs under the blanket chatting, browsing their phones, or playing mahjong.

There's also another device for warming the feet, usually placed between a sofa and coffee table. Again, a blanket is placed over it to maintain the warmth.

One annoyance I've always had with visiting China is that people don't use bath towels. Instead, they use the medium size towels that Americans usually use to dry their hands. They wash these towels daily instead of bi-weekly like in Western culture. This is a problem for me because I have much more surface area to dry. In the summer when it's humid, it's impossible to dry off completely, and in my frustration I end up sweating more liquid out. In the winter however, I step out of the hot shower into the unheated bathroom and scramble to dry off quickly so I can put clothes on for warmth. I'm not sure which one is worse, but next time I should just buy a bath towel when I arrive in China and use it for the trip.
