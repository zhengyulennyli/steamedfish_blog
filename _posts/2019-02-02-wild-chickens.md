We had another 6 hours or so before we would arrive at my maternal grandparents’ home. On the way through a mountain pass, we saw a hunter/trapper with two live, wild chickens hanging from their beaks. My uncle immediately pulled up next to her, blocking traffic in this single lane road, and my aunt rolled down her window to haggle with her. We ended up buying both for 100 rmb each, which apparently is a steal. #onlyinchina. They’ll be served as dinner sometime later this week.
