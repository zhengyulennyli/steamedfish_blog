Hi, friends! I'm taking three off work to travel the world. I'll be writing about my experiences here for those interested in following along, but mostly so I have proof that I didn't stay indoors all day and play video games for three months (what I would like to be doing, but then people would judge me).

FAQ:

* _Where are you going?_
  * Plans aren't final, but currently:
    * __China__, 2 weeks, to celebrate Chinese New Years.
    * __Japan__, 2 weeks, to visit my college roommate Dru, go snowboarding, and eat.
    * __Los Angeles/Irvine__, 1 week, because Lena has a work trip there.
    * __South America__, 2 weeks, because Lena has a work trip there, and also to learn Capoeria and attend the Carnival Festival in Brazil.
    * __Montreal__, 3 days, for a friend's bachelor party.
    * __France__, 1 week, to go snowboarding in the Alps.
    * __Portugal__, 1 week, to meetup with my mom and sister while my sister is on spring break.
  * Please contact me for specific dates and let me know if you want to meet up in any of these locations.
* _Google is letting you do this?_
  * Yup! I'm very lucky to have such a great employment situation. I had to get director's approval, and three months is the maximum I could take off while keeping my health insurance. I don't get paid, and my stock stops vesting, but I can go back to my team (unless something drastic happens) at the end of my time off.
* _What about your place in New York?_
  * My lease ended at the end of January and I put everything in storage for three months. Basically, I'm homeless, which is great since I'm no longer paying NYC rent.
